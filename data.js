I also designed a generic object with an exposed variable containing the database. This allowed us to select which row from the database would be applied to the object—and just like that, the job was done.\nOf course, things didn’t go perfectly smoothly. There were unexpected challenges, adjustments to make, and many variations of this generic object had to be created for highly specific cases with unique behaviors.\nHowever, in the end, this approach saved a significant amount of production time for both me and my teammates, especially when placing the numerous assets.',
